####Fed up with the dumb OSX color picker? How about one with Pixelmator style?

Version
----
1.1
    1. Fix a bug that will crash the application.
    2. Fix layout issue when there's a "choose" button in the color picker

1.0 ( Tested in __10.9.2__, should support __10.8__ though )

Notice
-----------
- Since most of the colorpicker out there won't look good in a dark window. So, once InnocentColorPicker is activated, it'll __hide the toolbar__ making you unable to change to other colorpickers anymore!
- InnocentColorPicker might not be automatically activated if there're other custom colorpickers.
- The toolbar will be visible after you uninstall InnocentColorPicker.

Installation
--------------
1. Download __[InnocentColorPicker]__
1. Unarchive
1. Copy `Innocent.colorPicker` to `~/Library/ColorPickers`

Uninstallation
--------------
Remove `~/Library/ColorPickers/Innocent.colorPicker`
